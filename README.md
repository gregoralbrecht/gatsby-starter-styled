Yet another Gatsby starter boilerplate. I built this for my personal use, but maybe someone finds it helpful.

## Features

All the Gatsby goodness included in most other starters (SEO, [offline support](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-offline), [Web App Manifest](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest), etc.) plus:

- [Styled-Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
- [Styled-System](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system)
- [Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) to easily set up font styles. If you want to add a custom font, I'd recommend self-hosting it with [Typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces)
- Google Analytics with both [gatsby-plugin-google-analytics](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-google-analytics/) and [react-ga](https://github.com/react-ga/react-ga) for more control over custom events
- Decent DX through opinionated linting with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and [Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint)
